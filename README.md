This project was developed as part of our 4th-semester coursework at the Department of Electronic and Telecommunications, University of Moratuwa. The project was a collaborative effort between two team members, focusing on designing and implementing a UHF RFID reader gate for a warehouse management system.

## Project Overview

Our project was divided into three main components:

1. **PCB with RF Circuit**

   The PCB design included an RF circuit, which was crucial for the functionality of the UHF RFID system. I took on the responsibility of designing this PCB and delivering it on time. This was actually a hard task as I had to design this within a week. This was a 6-layer PCB, and many high-speed PCB concepts were used. Since the bare PCB itself is expensive to produce, I had to carefully design this so we could make it work in one go.

2. **Antenna Design**

   I was responsible for designing the antenna, ensuring optimal performance and compatibility with the RFID system. I did all the calculations for the dimensions of the antenna. I used Ansys HFSS to simulate the antenna, and this was the first time that I worked with this platform. It took me more than 40 iterations to finally reach the working IFA antenna shown in the picture above. It was a wonderful journey.

3. **Enclosure**

   The enclosure, designed by my teammate Javin, provided a protective and functional housing for the system.

## Skills and Tools

This project allowed us to utilize and enhance our skills in various areas:

- **Altium**: Used for PCB design, ensuring a reliable and efficient RF circuit layout.
- **Ansys HFSS**: Employed for antenna design and simulation, allowing precise tuning and optimization.
- **SolidWorks**: Utilized in the design and development of the system enclosure, focusing on both aesthetics and practicality.

## Personal Reflection

This project was a significant step in my journey toward becoming an RF and Microwave Engineer. It provided hands-on experience with RF electronics, deepening my passion and understanding of the field.
